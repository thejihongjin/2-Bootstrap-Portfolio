### Assignment One Instructions (Bootstrap)
2. Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:
   * A navbar
   * A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)
     * eg. On `xs` and `sm` screens, content should take up the entire screen. On `md` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!
   * Responsive images

   **BONUS**
   Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site _(Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation)_
3. Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.

### BONUS
* Incorporate CSS animations in your portfolio. [More info here](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp).

                <p>Jihong is a pseudo-San Diego native (born in OH but raised in CA) who celebrates her birthday on Thanksgiving once every 6ish years.</p>
                <h3>EDUCATION</h3>
                <p>She attended Mira Mesa High and graduated in the top 5%, despite her questionable study habits.<sub>1</sub> After high school, she went on to earn her bachelor's degree in sociocultural anthropology, a few minors, and then her master's degree in AESE<sub>2</sub> all at UC San Diego. While pursuing a doctorate is not currently in her plans, Jihong enjoys expanding her knowledge base and learning new skillsets both personally and professionally.</p>
                <h3>HOBBIES</h3>
                <p>In her free time, Jihong can often be found playing soccer. In fact, she's quite a serial sub so if you ever need a girl to play, hit her up! (Well, hit her up after August because she'll be too busy attending classes till then.) And although soccer is her primary sport, Jihong also partakes in other physical activities from time to time, in recreational leagues and in social settings.<sub>3</sub></p>
                <p>Jihong also likes organizing groups of people - from soccer teams to group projects to weekend parties, she has a knack for communication and pulling people together to make things happen.<sub>4</sub> Other talents include singing car karaoke, making boba, and braiding hair.</p>

                    <sup>3</sup>Enthusiastically endorsed by her biffle Sweeney: "in terms of other sports, Jihong can only be described as 'terrible' at bowling, 'mediocre' at roller blading, but sufficient at most running sports."<br>
